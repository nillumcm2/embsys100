1.
a.  The main function takes the inputs from the stack by using the stack pointer (SP) and adding the value needed to increment to the second value and set register 1 equal to that, and then it sets the value of the of where the SP is pointing to and set register 0 equal to that which puts both of the inputs from the stack to two different registers.

b. The values are first R0 =  0x200003E8 and R1 = 0x200003EC which are the locations that the pointers are stored in memory.
