Two complement is done with negative numbers to stop the need for any special logic or steps when doing any operations with negative 
numbers. For example -3 + 1 would be 1101 + 0001 = 1110 which is -2 but without two complement it would be 1011 + 0001 = 1100 which would be -4 which would be wrong also in case where the out come would be positive the last bit would cause an overflow which would cause the output to be positve since the sign bit would be zero then which would be a positive value.
