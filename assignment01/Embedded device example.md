An embedded system example would be a temperature control unit within a drone. I think this device would work by accepting the input 
the tempeture from across the drone and then compare these values against preset values to determine if the drone is overheating.
Then send commands to other parts of the system to determine if other parts of the drone need to adjust to bring the drone back into the 
needed values for the drone.
